# #1782: The no_translate typeform is deprecated for input.
# - it can not be used instead of computer_braille:
# - it ignores comp6 rules
# - it does not insert begcomp and endcomp
# - it ignores character definition rules that map to more than one cell
# - it takes the first character definition rule rather than the last
# - it fails on characters outside of the range \x0020-\x007E
