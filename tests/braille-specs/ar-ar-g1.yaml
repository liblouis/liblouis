  # Cannot input punctuation marks and signs that consist of two cells, although they are
  # forward-translated normally. This is because the first part of the symbol represents another
  # symbol in the table. For example, the colon is 5-2 cannot be written because dot 5 represents
  # the Arabic comma, and this is applied to any other symbol starts with dot 5. Similarly, because
  # 56 represents semi-colon, it is not possible to input math symbols like + = or *. This happens
  # on NVDA, as I don't have the necessary skills to test using the liblouis built-in tools.

  # A rule to correct Shadda symbol (a diacritic mark to indicate that the letter follows it should
  # be doubled in pronunciation). It should be written before the character in Arabic braille
  # code. This will consist of every Arabic character followed by the Shadda diacritic symbol, and a
  # dot pattern of the braille Shadda followed by the character.
  
  # I used the "noback" opcode so that I can avoid lots of input issues due to the conflict with the
  # capital letter sign. This means that the user will have to input this symbol normally after the
  # character as if he is writing from the standard keyboard, but it will be displayed correctly. In
  # the standard Arabic braille, Shadda should be also typed before the character.
