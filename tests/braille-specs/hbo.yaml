# Test Notes/ Problems with the Hebrew writing system. 
# The problem with Hebrew is that it is written with a 4 stanza Unicode value.
# Hebrew is written with the 4 following stanza ‘s. 1 consonant, 2 dagesh which
# indicates pronunciation for the consonant, 3 a vowel, and 4 a cantillation
# mark. 
# Adding to this complexity, sometimes these stanzas are presented visually in
# the correct order for sighted readers, but in the Unicode, this order could be
# arranged in a couple of different ways.
#For example: 1 consonant, 2 dagesh, 3 vowel. Another way that is just as common:
# 1 consonant, 2vowel, 3 dagesh. 

# For this reason, this test document presents portions of text which evaluate
# all possibilities of the above mentioned order to ensure correct and accurate
# braille, in every circumstance. 
# Further, the current Hebrew table does not reflect accurate braille for the
# orders of the unicode stanza mentioned above. 

tests:

# Test 1. This is the first test developed. This test passed and worked well,
# nbut does not demonstrate other problems with the Consanant-vowel-dagesh
# problems mentioned above.

#test 3, This test is derived from the BHS and includes notes from the Masorah,

# table does not accurately produce the desired braille for the consanant, vowel,
