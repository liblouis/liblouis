The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.23.0. The release is available for download at:

https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

This release contains significant updates to many existing braille
tables (Chinese bopomofo, Hungarian, Japanese, Russian, Swedish, UEB
grade 2 Ukrainian). On top of that it also contains new tables for
*Chinese Common Braille Scheme*, Kinyarwanda and Luganda thanks to
Cary-Rowen and Jake Kyle. Behind the scenes Samuel Thibault has been
working tirelessly to fix memory related bugs.

I'd like to thank everybody for helping to bring liblouis forward.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues [3]_.

New features
------------

-  None

Bug fixes
---------

-  Fix a problem in the parsing of faulty unbalanced context
   expressions. Thanks to Samuel Thibault.
-  Fix a buffer overflow problem when ``output.length`` is larger than
   ``input.length``. Thanks to Samuel Thibault.
-  Fix an endless loop in the handling of computer braille. Thanks to
   Bert Frees.

Braille table improvements
--------------------------

-  Remove computer braille from Japanese Kantenji as it is not part of
   the standard. Thanks to Kensaku Yoza.
-  Bring Swedish tables up to date with the latest standard published by
   Punktskriftsnämnden (the Swedish Braille Authority) in 2009. The
   table for uncontracted braille was replaced and new tables for
   (partially and fully) contracted braille have been added. Thanks to
   David Renström from Insyn Scandinavia AB.
-  Improvements to Hungarian (added more exceptions) and migration to
   the ``nonumsign`` opcode thanks to Attila Hammer.
-  Fixed a bug in the Ukrainian table that led to wrong translation of
   some uppercase letters. Thanks to Andrey Yakuboy and Bert Frees.
-  Augment the UEB grade 2 tables to resolve an ambiguity between lower
   groupsigns and punctuation at the beginning of words by placing a
   letter sign at the front of punctuation. This resolves an ambiguity
   between, for example, "discount" and ".count". Thanks to Krzysztof
   Drewniak.
-  Add a new table for *Chinese Common Braille Scheme* which is a type
   of braille used for spelling Mandarin Chinese. It is a variant of the
   *Chinese Current Braille System* but has more perfect marking rules
   and produces less ambiguity than the latter. For more information see
   the comments in ``zhcn-cbs.ctb``. Thanks to Cary-Rowen and Frank.
-  Updates to the Chinese bopomofo braille table thanks to Bo-Cheng
   Jhan:

   -  Update braille patterns of some Chinese characters and phrases
   -  Add braille patterns for various Greek symbols
   -  Add "Math rules" section and the mixed number rule
   -  Add braille patterns for ☐ (⣏⣀⣹), ☑ (⣏⣿⣹), and ☒ (⣏⣭⣹)

-  New table for Kinyarwanda braille thanks to Jake Kyle from Compass
   Braille.
-  New table for Luganda braille thanks to Jake Kyle from Compass
   Braille.
-  Improvements to the Russian contracted braille table thanks to Andrey
   Yakuboy:

   -  Now prefixes "из" and "без" are correctly contracted before hard
      sign (ъ).
   -  Fixed a contraction for word "кое-где", now it is contracted
      according to rules.
   -  Other minor fixes and improvements.
