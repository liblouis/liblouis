Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

This release contains major updates to Arabic, Dutch 8-dot computer
braille, German, Russian computer braille, Ukrainian computer braille
and Uzbek. Also there are new tables for Israeli multi-language
Hebrew/Arabic/English braille and Malay. Aside from that there have been
many code cleanups and bug fixes.
