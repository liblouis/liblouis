The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.29.0. The release is available for download at:

https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

A lot of hard work by Andrey, Anthony, Attila, Bert, Bue and James went
into this release. We have many improvements for UEB, better support for
Belarusian and Ukrainian literary braille, a major upgrade for Turkish
and miscellaneous enhancements for Kannada, Danish, Dutch, Esperanto and
Malay. There is also a brand new table for classical Greek for Spanish
braille readers.

I'd like to thank everybody for helping to bring liblouis forward.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues [3]_.

New features
------------

-  There is a new uncontracted braille table to read classical Greek
   characters according to the technical document B12-1 by the Spanish
   Braille Commission, thanks to Iván Novegil.

Bug fixes
---------

-  None

Braille table improvements
--------------------------

-  Fixed issues with Kannada table ``kannada.cti`` thanks to Jake Kyle.
-  Improvements to the Belarusian and Ukrainian literary braille tables
   thanks to Andrey Yakuboy:

   -  Added support for back translation to the Belarusian and Ukrainian
      literary Braille tables (``bel.utb`` and ``uk.utb`` respectively).
   -  Changed the dot patterns for parentheses in the Ukrainian braille
      table from 126-345 to 2356.
   -  Added new tables for Belarusian and Ukrainian braille with
      indication of capital letters (``bel-detailed.utb`` and
      ``uk-detailed.utb`` respectively).

-  Minor improvements to the Danish tables thanks to Bue
   Vester-Andersen:

   -  Fixed definition of dollar sign ($)
   -  Fixed rules for applying section sign (§)
   -  Fixed contraction of some words

-  Updates to UEB Contracted thanks to Anthony Tibbs:

   -  Final letter groupsigns will not be used immediately following
      capital indicators (e.g. when the first letter of the groupsign is
      capitalized, or the groupsign follows a capitalized passage) per
      UEB Rule 10.8.2

-  Updates to UEB thanks to James Bowden:

   -  Back translating braille dot 3 now results in the ordinary
      apostrophe U+0027 rather than U+2019
   -  Dot 5, used for "spaced digits" is only applied if a no-break
      space U+00a0 is used in the input. It fixes an issue with British
      postcodes which should be treated as two separate items. It also
      means that if someone wants spaced digits, numbers have to be
      joined together with no-break spaces deliberately.

-  Do not collapse Unicode braille in Dutch, thanks to Davy Kager.
-  Improvements to Hungarian (added more exceptions) thanks to Attila
   Hammer.
-  Added support for back-translation to the Esperanto table, thanks to
   Bue Vester-Andersen.
-  Major upgrade to the Turkish tables thanks to Oğuz UĞUR with lots of
   help from Attila Hammer.

   -  add support for accented characters
   -  add punctuation symbols from the Turkish Braille Writing Guideline
   -  fix some contractions

-  Corrections to the Malay Table thanks to lbk2907.

Other changes
-------------

-  Duplicate emphasis classes are no longer warnings thanks to Christian
   Egli. There are cases where emphasis redefinition is legitimate. They
   are simply logged now.
