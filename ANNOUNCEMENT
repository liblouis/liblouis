liblouis 3.34.0 has been released

The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.34.0. The release is available for download at:

https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

This release brings significant improvements to various language tables,
particularly for Classical/Biblical Hebrew where three main standards
are now supported. We have a new table for Thai Grade 2 contracted
braille, and substantial updates to Lithuanian braille tables. There are
also improvements to Hungarian, Dutch, Norwegian, and Turkish tables. On
the technical side, there's new support for building macOS universal
binaries and the pre-built html and plain text documentation is no
longer packaged with the released tarball.

I'd like to thank everybody for helping to bring liblouis forward.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues [3]_.

New features
------------

-  A new table for Thai Braille Grade 2, a contracted Braille system,
   has been added thanks to Chatupol Nootatong.

Braille table improvements
--------------------------

-  Hungarian improvements thanks to Attila Hammer.
-  Fix a bug in the Dutch table related to apostrophes after a number
   which are not always a minute sign. Thanks to Bert Frees.
-  Fix the metadata of the Russian 6-dot computer braille table thanks
   to Bert Frees and Andrey Yakuboy.
-  Minor improvements to the Norwegian Braille: Some small fixes
   regarding 6 dot, added Cyrillic alphabet and added certain new
   characters to 8 dot, including bullet points used by JAWS when using
   Liblouis for 8 dot. Thanks to Lars Bjørndal and Bert Frees.
-  Major changes to the Lithuanian braille tables thanks to Rimas
   Kudelis

   -  Renamed ``lt.ctb`` to ``lt-8dot.utb``
   -  Both tables have been reviewed and modified.

      -  The 6-dot table is now closer to the national standard issued
         in 2019.
      -  The 8-dot table is now intended to align with the 6-dot table
         instead of the 8-dot standard from 2011.
      -  Some whitespaces in the table files have been eliminated to
         make them easier to read using braille terminals.

-  Fixes for back-translation issues involving subscript numerals,
   diacritic marks, and capital letters turning into Greek letters.
   Makes no changes to the UEB-style cuneiform transliteration table.
   Thanks to Eric Harvey.
-  Major Expansion and Improvements to Classical/Biblical Hebrew thanks
   to Eric Harvey.

   -  Two new translation tables have been added so that the three main
      standards for Classical Hebrew are now available:

      1. The original International Hebrew Braille Code (``hbo.utb``)
      2. The system for full cantillation developed by Ray McAllister,
         Matthew Yeater, and Sarah Blake LaRose
         (``hbo-cantillated.utb``)
      3. The compact standard without dagesh or shewa represented in the
         Katz transcription manual (``hbo-slim.utb``)

   -  ``hbo.utb`` is now the table for the International Hebrew Braille
      Code. Before it was used for the IHBC-McCallister system (now
      ``hbo-cantillated.utb``). The International Hebrew Braille Code is
      the most-established and widely used standard for Classical
      Hebrew, so it seems right to make it the basic table.
   -  Most of the Hebrew-specific rules are contained in ``.uti`` files,
      and the ``.utb`` files only add rules for uncontracted English
      support. Since Classical Hebrew readers usually have another first
      language, this allows non-English speakers to create custom
      translation tables with Hebrew and their first language, or for
      easier inclusion in multilingual tables like
      ``ancient-languages-us.utb``.
   -  In addition to the new tables, there are improvements to the
      ``hbo-cantillated.utb`` table for consistency and to make sure
      that braille output matches that produced by Duxbury as closely as
      possible:

      -  Ultra long vowels now contract consistently.
      -  Cantillation marks no longer interrupt the contractions for
         ultra-long vowels (hiriq-yod and tsere-yod).
      -  Holam now always renders properly as 135 and holam waw as 246.

-  Improvements to Turkish grade 1 and Turkish computer braille, thanks
   to Oğuz Uğur and Ozancan Karataş

Other changes
-------------

-  There is a new configure option to build macOS universal binaries
   thanks to Bert Frees.
-  Fix incorrect (non-https) link in the documentation thanks to
   jinwoolee.
-  The pre-built html and plain text documentation is no longer packaged
   with the released tarball. All formats of the documentation can still
   be built from the source and from the released tarball as explained
   in the README. Thanks to Christian Egli.
