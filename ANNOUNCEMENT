3.36.0. The release is available for download at:

https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

This release brings various updates to braille tables, particularly for
Slovakian and Norwegian in line with the respective changes to their the
braille standards. There are new tables for Macedonian uncontracted
braille and the long awaited table for English Grade 3 is finally here.
On the technical side, there are modernized Python bindings and better
support for building liblouis for environments such as Android.

I'd like to thank everyone for helping to bring liblouis forward.

Other changes
