liblouis 3.32.0 has been released

The liblouis developer team is proud to announce the liblouis release
3.32.0. The release is available for download at:

https://github.com/liblouis/liblouis/releases

Introduction
============

Liblouis is an open-source braille translator and back-translator. It
features support for computer, literary and math braille, supports
contracted and uncontracted translation for many, many languages [1]_.
It plays an important role in an open source accessibility stack and is
used by screenreaders such as NVDA, Orca and JAWS. A companion project
liblouisutdml [2]_ deals with formatting of braille.

Noteworthy changes in this release
==================================

A lot of intense work by Matt, Paul, Leonard, Eric, Sarah and Bert went
into this release. There are new tables for Biblical Language and
Ancient Near Eastern Studies. We have improvements for UEB, Spanish,
Turkish and Hungarian. There are also a couple of new features, for
example the handling of the language metadata has been extended to
handle language ranges.

I'd like to thank all the very dedicated contributors for helping to
push liblouis forward.

For a detailed list of all the changes refer to the list of closed
issues [3]_.

New features
------------

-  ``lou_translate`` now has an option to specify a display table. This
   is especially useful when using a query. Before it would just default
   to a Unicode display table, thanks to Christian Egli.
- Meta data for ``language`` and ``region`` can now be specified using
  a IETF Extended Language Range [4]_. This is particularly useful for
  accessing tables related to a specific region, for instance. Thanks
  to Bert Frees.

Bug fixes
---------

-  Fix a memory problem in the ``getTable`` function. Thanks to the
   oss-fuzz project for reporting and to Christian Egli for fixing it.
-  Fix a build problem on Windows related to ``strncasecmp`` which was
   reported at the last minute by Leonard de Ruijter and fixed by
   Christian Egli.

Braille table improvements
--------------------------

-  Updates to Spanish grade 1 thanks to José Manuel Delicado:

   -  Removed lowered digits. This allows certain punctuation to be
      written again.
   -  Included ``digits6Dots.uti``. This prevents the numsign from
      disappearing.
   -  The symbols ``.`` and ``,`` are used as numeric mode chars.
   -  Added the ``noback`` operator to the apostrophe symbol, since it's
      not very used and conflicts with the ``.``.

-  Extensive fixes to the UEB computer code thanks to James Bowden.
-  Improvements to Turkish grade 2 thanks to Oğuz Uğur and Attila
   Hammer.
-  Hungarian improvements (added more exceptions) thanks to Attila
   Hammer.
-  There is now an include table for symbols referencing the critical
   apparatus in critical texts thanks to Matt Yeater.

Other changes
-------------

-  Migrate to ``realloc-posix`` from gnulib, as ``realloc-gnu`` that we
   used before is now deprecated. Thanks to Christian Egli.
-  Improvements to the manual thanks to Huan Wu.
-  Thanks to Rob Beezer we now have instructions on how to install
   Python bindings in a virtual environment.

Deprecation notice
------------------

-  None

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

-  If liblouis has been compiled for 16-bit Unicode it will now error if
   a table contains characters outside of that range. Previously it
   would issue a warning and ignore the problem. Thanks to Christian
   Egli.
