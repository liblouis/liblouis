# The first Hebrew Braille table hosted on Lib Louis was developed
# by the Library for the Blind and the Ministry of Education in Israel.
# That  table is based on the IHBC which was developed in the
# mid-1930’s. Please see
# World Braille usage 3rd edition, p. 74. 
# However, Classical or Biblical Hebrew, which is used
# in the Hebrew Bible and other liturgical literature, contains cantillation marks
# that are not supported by the Hebrew table mentioned above.
# This table seeks to provide access to these accents.
# This table is   also based upon the tables mentioned above.  This table only
# departs from it where the accents are concerned. With this table,
# the user will have access to the accents and Masorah in BHS and BHS Quinta.
# For more information about the IHBC and How it was developed:
# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Braille#:~:text=The%20International%20Hebrew%20Braille%20Code>

#Special thank you to Ray McAllister and Matthew Yeater- Yeshurun
# for developing the braille for the cantillation. Also to
# Abby Howell for the suggestions to include support for Yiddish.
# Extra gratitude to Sarah LaRose, Eric Harvey, and Leonard de Ruijder
# for the helpful suggestions.
