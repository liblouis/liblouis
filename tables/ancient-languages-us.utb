# This table provides support for biblical languages as well as
# ancient Near Eastern (ANE) languages. This includes biblical or
# classical Hebrew with the vowels, cantellation marks, as well as the
# Masorah. This table also includes support for criticle
# apparatus. Because biblical studies is often placed within context
# of ancient Near Eastern studies, especially in commentaries,
# dictionaries, and academic articles, this table also provides
# support for Syriac, Ugaritic and Akkadian. Akkadian is represented
# in either the American or German (Borger) system. This table
# contains the U.S. system for Akkadian. If you are desiring access to
# the ANE studies with the Borger system, please see
# ancient-languages-borger.utb.
#
# These braille codes were developed by a group of both blind and
# sighted scholars in an academic setting. Special thank you to Louis
# Saenz, Inbal Baum and Shai Gordon for helping Matthew Yeater develop
# the braille codes. Thank you to Ray McAllister, Sarah LaRose and
# Eric Harvey for their helpful contributions.
