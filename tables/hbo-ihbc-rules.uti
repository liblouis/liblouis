# This file contains rules for the 1946 International Hebrew Braille
# Code as described in:
# Dubov, Leopold. “Preface.” In The Holy Bible: The Complete Hebrew
# Text Embossed in Twenty Volumes, Volume One: Genesis; New York: Jewish Braille
# Institute, 1950.
# This was the first official braille code developed for
# Classical/Biblical Hebrew and is still the most widely used today.

# This file contains the Hebrew rules that are necessary for the
# IHBC standard but not shared by other Classical/Biblical Hebrew
# tables.
# It requires hbo-common-rules.uti to function.
# It is included in hbo.utb along with basic Latin alphabet
# support, but can also be included in tables with other secondary
# languages.

# Developed by Eric J. Harvey with support from the national
# Endowment for the Humanities (USA) and Stanford University.
# Many thanks to Leonard de Ruijter, Sarah Blake LaRose, Matthew
# Yeater, and Paul Geoghegan for their help developing and testing the
# tables, and to Abby Howell for suggesting the inclusion of Yiddish
# characters and reviewing code.
