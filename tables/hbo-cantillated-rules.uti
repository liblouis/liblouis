# This file contains rules for fully cantillated Biblical Hebrew
# according to the system developed by Ray McAllister, Matthew
# Yeater, and Sarah Blake LaRose in 2014. See:
# <https://www.duxburysystems.com/biblical_scholar.htm>
# This code builds upon the 1946 International Hebrew Braille Code,
# adding support for the full complement of cantillation marks.

# This file contains the Hebrew rules that are necessary for the
# IHBC-McAllister system but not shared by other Classical/Biblical
# Hebrew tables.
# It requires hbo-common-rules.uti to function.
# It is included in hbo-cantillated.utb along with basic Latin alphabet
# support, but can also be included in tables with other secondary
# languages.

# This code was first implemented in LibLouis by Matthew Yeater and Paul Geoghegan and further
# developed by Eric J. Harvey with support from the national
# Endowment for the Humanities (USA) and Stanford University.
# Many thanks to Leonard de Ruijter and Sarah Blake LaRose for their
# help developing and testing the tables, and to Abby Howell for
# suggesting the inclusion of Yiddish characters and reviewing code.

# Include common characters
include hbo-common-rules.uti
