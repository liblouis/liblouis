# This file contains rules for the Hebrew transcription standard in
# Eliezer Katz, Hebrew Braille: A Manual for Hebrew Braille and
# Basic Hebrew (with Attention to Transcribers), New York: JBI
# International, 1961.
# This was a revision of the 1946 International Hebrew Braille
# Code. It eliminated the shewa and dagesh to create a more compact
# text.

# This file contains the Hebrew rules that are necessary for the
# Katz standard but not shared by other Classical/Biblical Hebrew
# tables.
# It requires hbo-common-rules.uti to function.
# It is included in hbo-slim.utb along with basic Latin alphabet
# support, but can also be included in tables with other secondary
# languages.

# Developed by Eric J. Harvey with support from the national
# Endowment for the Humanities (USA) and Stanford University.
# Many thanks to Leonard de Ruijter, Sarah Blake LaRose, Matthew
# Yeater, and Paul Geoghegan for their help developing and testing the
# tables, and to Abby Howell for suggesting the inclusion of Yiddish
# characters and reviewing code.
