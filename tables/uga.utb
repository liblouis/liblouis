# The braille code for Ugaritic is innovative, but accurately
# represents the Cuneiform. The braille code for Ugaritic is
# represented in braille as the name for the sign in Ugaritic. Thus,
# if the Ugaritic sign is a "Alepha," then the braille code for this
# sign would be a dot 1. for more information on the Ugaritic
# language, please go to

# <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugaritic>

# This braille code was developed by a group of both blind and sighted
# scholars in an academic setting. Special thank you to Ray McAllister
# and Matthew Yeater for your help in developing this braille code.
