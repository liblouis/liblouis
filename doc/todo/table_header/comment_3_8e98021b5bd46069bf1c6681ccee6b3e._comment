Design Proposal
===============

I've tried to make the initial design as simple and elegant as
possible, with little special handling. More advanced stuff can
be added later. The system only deals with the problem of table
discovery, NOT with the problem of localization. 

Table metadata must be added in the form of key-value fields in
comment lines at the top of the table. A metadata field can also be a
single keyword without a colon and value (this syntax was chosen in
favor of the special TAGS field in order to keep things simple). A
keyword without a value is shorthand for <keyword>:yes.

    #+FOO: value
    #+BAR: value
    #+BAZ

Before tables can be queried, all the table files are analyzed and
indexed by liblouis. Only tables with metadata in the header will be
considered during a query.

A table query is a list of key-value pairs or keywords without a
value, separated by spaces. Keys and values are joined by a colon and
no spaces.

The API
-------

void index(char** tablePath);

  Parses, analyzes and indexes all tables on tablePath. tablePath is a
  colon-separated list of directories to search for tables. This
  function must be called prior to find(). Warning/error messages are
  given when tables contain invalid or duplicate metadata fields.

char* find(char* query);

  Finds the best match for a table query. Returns a string with the
  table name. Warning/error messages are given when the query is
  invalid.


The match algorithm
-------------------

1. Validation

   Invalid fields are discarded. When a table or a query contains more
   than one field with the same key (after normalization, see #2), all
   except the first are ignored.

2. Normalization

   Fields in table headers and queries are normalized. Keys and values
   are converted to lowercase, underscores are replaced with
   hyphens. Keywords without a value are given the value \"yes\". From
   then on, they are treated as any other field. Fields with key
   \"locale\" are replaced with 1, 2 or 3 other fields, depending on the
   value. A \"language\" field if the locale value has a language part,
   a \"country\" field if the locale value has a country part, and a
   \"variant\" field if the locale value has a variant part. From then
   on, \"language\", \"country\" and \"variant\" fields are treated as any
   other field.

3. Match computation

   The query is matched against each table, and for each table a match
   quotient is computed. The table with the highest match quotient is
   selected. Each key in the combined list of distinct keys in query
   and table contributes to the quotient of that table:

   - if the key exists in both the query and the table and the values
     are equal (match): +5
   - if the key exists in both the query and the table and the values
     are not equal (negative match): -25
   - if the key exists only in either the query or the table: -1

   The weights might have to be tweaked a bit.
