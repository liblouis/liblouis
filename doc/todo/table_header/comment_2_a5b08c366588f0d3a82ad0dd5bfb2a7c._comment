For my DAISY Pipeline 2 work I have been nurturing the idea of selecting translators
based on some kind of \"translator query\". The syntax I am proposing is inspired by
CSS media queries. A query is basically a list of key-value pairs or keywords.

Let's take Greg's example:

    #afr#1#Afrikaans Uncontracted#za#Afrikaans ongekontrakteerde

It consists of 5 metadata fields. 3 of them can be used for automatic table selection.
Combining the two locale fields (language and country) into a single tag, the
corresponding query would look like this:

    (locale:af-ZA) (grade:1)

The same key-value pairs could be put in liblouis table headers. I like the idea of
having the metadata in special comments, in order to assure backwards compatibility
of new tables with old library versions, and so that implementations of the liblouis
table format can choose whether or not they support metadata.

A possible syntax could be `#+<KEY>: <value>`

    #+LOCALE: af-ZA
    #+GRADE: 1
    #+PRETTY_NAME: Afrikaans ongekontrakteerde
    #+PRETTY_NAME_EN: Afrikaans Uncontracted

(This is org-mode's syntax.) The keywords would be case-insensitive. Some keywords
will be standard, such as LOCALE, GRADE and PRETTY_NAME, but I wouldn't restrict
the allowed keywords in any way, in order to keep the system flexible.

The CSS query syntax also allows single keywords, without a value. For example:

    (ueb) (grade:2)

This could be reflected in a `#+TAGS` field with a list of space-separated \"tags\":
    
    #+LOCALE: en-US
    #+GRADE: 2
    #+TAGS: ueb
