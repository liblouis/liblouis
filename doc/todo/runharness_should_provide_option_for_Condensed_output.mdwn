When the runharness script was initially written it was designed to provide output in the same format as the c tests.
When there are a few errors this multiline format is fine, but when there
are hundreds of failed tests, the output is too verbose, making it hard
to grep for particular errors or types of errors.

example output for 3 failures:

    --- Braille Difference Failure: ./en-ueb-g2-dictionary_harness.txt ---
    comment:                  ''
    input:                    'Aeroflot'
    expected brl:             '⠠⠁⠻⠕⠋⠇⠕⠞'
    actual brl:               '⠠⠁⠻⠷⠇⠕⠞'
    --- end ---

    --- Braille Difference Failure: ./en-ueb-g2-dictionary_harness.txt ---
    comment:                  ''
    input:                    'Aeroflot's'
    expected brl:             '⠠⠁⠻⠕⠋⠇⠕⠞⠄⠎'
    actual brl:               '⠠⠁⠻⠷⠇⠕⠞⠄⠎'
    --- end ---

    --- Braille Difference Failure: ./en-ueb-g2-dictionary_harness.txt ---
    comment:                  ''
    input:                    'Alcyone'
    expected brl:             '⠠⠁⠇⠉⠽⠕⠝⠑'
    actual brl:               '⠠⠁⠇⠉⠽⠐⠕'
    --- end ---

Runharness should have a flag that produces the entire failure output on one line.
