While initially planned as mainly a bug fix release this release
contains some notable new features: There is a new tool to trace which
rules have been used to perform a translation. Also along with other new
tables the long awaited table for UEB is finally here.

### New features

#### New tool to trace rule application

There is a new tool `lou_trace` which helps to trace which rules have
been used to perform a Braille translation. This is helpful for writing
Braille tables. See the documentation for more information.
