According to liblouis 2.5.4 and current master (9e15226f).

There are two problems in zh-tw.ctb:

1. The upper and lower cases of Greek alphabet phi:

    sign \x03A6 46-1257
    sign \x03C6 46-125

According to Greek Braille - Wikipedia, they should be:

    sign \x03A6 46-1247
    sign \x03C6 46-124

2. The lowercase translation of Greek alphabet Theta is missing:

    sign \x03B8 46-1456                                                            

Sorry, this is the my first time to write on liblouis.org. If my format or text is not clear, these changes are specified clearly in the patch as an attachment.
