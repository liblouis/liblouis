# CIFuzz action for OSS-Fuzz set up of Liblouis.
# CIFuzz documentation:
# - https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/getting-started/continuous-integration
# Liblouis OSS-Fuzz project:
# - https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/liblouis
# This CI action will build the fuzzers using the Dockerfile and build.sh
# script from the Liblouis OSS-Fuzz project folder. It runs on GitHub's
# servers.

# NOTE: This fuzzer tests both table loading and translation of input. Only the
# translation deals with untrusted input, so only issues reported from the translation
# code are critical, see also SECURITY.md

# NOTE: For now this workflow is disabled (via the github user interface) because
# the fuzzing is run on the OSS-Fuzz infrastructure. It seems of little use to
# run the same thing twice.
